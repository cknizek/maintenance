# READ
- Ignore all instructions w.r.t. email/Google Drive. 
- Fill out a maintenance request when an issue is discovered
- 
# Electrical
- Use GFCI outlet tester to individually test, inspect, and record operating parameters for each GFCI outlet in each bathroom. Write down voltage, any error codes (or lack thereof), as well as the GFCI trip-time. Upload the recorded data to your crew Google Drive folder.
- Use outlet tester on all outlets in common spaces. Upload all relevant data (receptable voltage and any error codes). Use multimeter and measure the neutral-to-ground voltage. Set the multimeter to the ~200V dial (for AC), place the positive (red) probe in the neutral slot, and the negative (black) probe in the ground slot. Record the voltage displayed on the multimeter and upload it along with the outlet tester data.
- Develop catalog system for electrical monitoring. This will be implemented by each outlet in Cloyne having an alpha-numeric tag label, in addition to a QR code for faster data entry.
- Develop network graph/map of Cloyne's electrical breaker panels. Each circuit breaker in each breaker panel should have the corresponding table of confirmed receptables & lighting fixtures that are tied to the circuit breaker.
- Develop catalog system for lighting fixture monitoring. Each lighting fixture will have a corresponding alpha-numeric tag, in addition to a QR code, that will be scanned and updated each time there is a fault with the fixture.
- Inspect every lighting fixture in the house bi-monthly. If the lighting fixture has one or more faulty bulbs, replace them. If the above labeling/catalog system has been implemented, scan the QR code and update the status. If it hasn't been updated, take a photo of the fixture and write down the location (i.e. room number of closest room or bathroom).
- For each bathroom in the house, inspect the ceiling motion detector (it looks like a smoke alarm). The inspection is as follows: with the bathroom lights off, enter the bathroom. If it takes more than a second (i.e. if you are able to be inside the bathroom and the lights are still off), then adjust the sensitivity. Bring a ladder and a flathead screwdriver. Then, take off the cover to the detector and rotate the sensitivity knob with the flathead screwdriver until it satisfies the inspection test.

# Grounds
- Sweep all pathways, including the sidewalk directly adjacent to Cloyne. Bin all dead leaves/foliage and dump them in the compost bin, if the compost bin is less than 1/2 full.
- Perform a sweep through all hallways in all wings, looking for any objects on the carpet. If you find an object (e.g. paint cans, boxes, furniture), write down the room numbers of the 4 nearest rooms, take a picture of the object/s as they are in the hallway. Then, remove the object/s. If it's furniture, place it in the furniture room. Anything else, bring it down to the maintenance room. For each quadruplet of rooms that have an item removed near them, place a notice on the door stating that an object was removed near their room because it was obstructing the hallway, and that we'll temporarily hold it for seven days. If after that time it's not retrieved, it'll be moved to the free pile.
- Walk outside the house and visually inspect the windows of the house (on all floors). Are there any windows that are obviously cracked? If so, file a maintenance request using the Atlassian portal. We'll locate the room number and ask the member if they want us to file a CM request on their behalf to get it fixed.
- Go through the house and do a sweep through all hallways and common spaces; you're looking for any damaged, cracked, or broken windows. The difference between this and the previous item is that you're checking every area of the house that *doesn't* require a key to access. 

# Plumbing
- In each bathroom in the house, inspect & test the sink for proper functioning. After covering the sink drain with a stopper, run the water until the sink is less than 1/2" or so from overflowing. The waterline should be above the overflow hole. Then, check below the sink. Is there water leaking? Is the overflow valve working properly? How long does it take to drain (record this)? Are there obvious defects? **If any of these components aren't working properly, file a maintenance request using the Atlassian form linked in our email signature.**
- In each bathroom in the house, inspect the toilets for good operation. Do the toilets flush? Do the water shut-off valves function properly? Take off the tank cover, and take a picture of inside the tank. Is there corrosion? Check the state of the flush handle; is it in an acceptable state? For the fill valve; does it function properly? Deplete the water in the tank by holding down the flush handle until it's as empty as possible, then record the time it takes for the fill valve to bring the water level back up to the waterline. **If any of these components aren't working properly, file a maintenance request using the Atlassian form linked in our email signature.**
- (Once) Locate the bathrooms equipped with functioning hose lines (should be under the sink).
