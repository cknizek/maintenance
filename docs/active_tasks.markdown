# Electrical
- Use GFCI outlet tester to individually test, inspect, and record operating parameters for each GFCI outlet in each bathroom. Write down voltage, any error codes (or lack thereof), as well as the GFCI trip-time. Upload the recorded data to your crew Google Drive folder.
- Develop catalog system for electrical monitoring. This will be implemented by each outlet in Cloyne having an alpha-numeric tag label, in addition to a QR code for faster data entry.
- Develop network graph/map of Cloyne's electrical breaker panels. Each circuit breaker in each breaker panel should have the corresponding table of confirmed receptables & lighting fixtures that are tied to the circuit breaker.

# Grounds
- Sweep all pathways, including the sidewalk directly adjacent to Cloyne. Bin all dead leaves/foliage and dump them in the compost bin, if the compost bin is less than 1/2 full.
- Perform a sweep through all hallways in all wings, looking for any objects on the carpet. If you find an object (e.g. paint cans, boxes, furniture), write down the room numbers of the 4 nearest rooms, take a picture of the object/s as they are in the hallway. Then, remove the object/s. If it's furniture, place it in the furniture room. Anything else, bring it down to the maintenance room. For each quadruplet of rooms that have an item removed near them, place a notice on the door stating that an object was removed near their room because it was obstructing the hallway, and that we'll temporarily hold it for seven days. If after that time it's not retrieved, it'll be moved to the free pile.
