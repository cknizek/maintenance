### Contacting us
1. Habitability hours can only be submitted through the form in our email signature. If you emailed us asking us to put in your hours (or something similar), your email was deleted. 
1. Maintenance requests can only be submitted through the maintenance request portal in our email signature, labeled "Maintenance Request Form". Similarly, if you tried to email a maintenance request, your email was deleted.
1. (!) Maintenance questions must be submitted through the "Questions for maintenance" section of the portal. You can reach the portal by clicking on "Maintenance Request Form". 
1. We only monitor our email inbox from 6:00-7:00pm daily. 
1. I'm working on creating a formal policy that can be referenced, rather than relying on email.

### Habitability/HI
2a. The bounty board is a list of suggestions. If you're worried about hours, walk around --> find something or somewhere that's dirty/dusty (take a picture) --> clean it (take another picture) --> submit form with # hours worked (include pictures). Anywhere that's not behind a locked door is fair game.
22b. There's no benefit to logging more than 4 hours. It won't roll over to workshift or anything else.
